## Welcome to this page

So, markdown. A good thing. (Modified this on the iPad; need to pay to commit in WorkingCopy. Will get back to that.) Now modifying on the Chromebook. Trying to make sure it will work out. 

OK, circling back here. Adding the Next Steps from the [instructions](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) that resulted in this page.

TODO: there's got to be some kind of a CMS... it can't really just be this one file... really. Guessing I'll find it [here](https://docs.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/)

TODO: mess with the theme because it's a futzy thing to do. 

TODO: you really need red squiggles. 

TODO: is there a geopol checker? 

TODO: where should TODO's really go?

TODO: how about a custom domain? https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site

### Write the damn thing
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/rdxn/rdxn.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Of course you will try out other editors. 

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

And of course over time you'll be able to come back here and see the changes in the text over time. Hi future self!

### Markdown Cheatsheet

Syntax. A good thing. There are conventions for... well, lots. Not clear to you what seems like does just yet, but it will make sense. For example, single open quote (typically near the ~) is `code` but not clear what three in a row mean... a block? 

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/rdxn/rdxn.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
