## Welcome to this page

So, markdown. A good thing. 

### Changing text
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/rdxn/rdxn.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Of course you will try out other editors. 

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

And of course over time you'll be able to come back here and see the changes in the text over time. Hi future Dean!

### Markdown

Syntax. A good thing. There are convetions for... well, lots. Not clear to you what ``` does just yet, but it will make sense. 

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/rdxn/rdxn.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
