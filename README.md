Seriously, there's nothing to see here. 

Exercise in 

1. Use git *for reals*, not just an exercise. (Yeah, I see the problem there.)
2. Have a "blog" to dump notes into and make sense of them for consumption by others (v email or G doc)
3. Comfort using code editors again. 
4. Clear the mind from all these apps and attention sucking things... 
5. Comfort with .md (like, next change can make this a real numbered list rather than the numbers I typed in)

That's enough for now. That'll do, pig; that'll do.
